schema.sql: (done?) decimal for price is iffy

	Products(pid: integer, name: string, price: integer)
	Sales(pid: integer, cid: integer, quantity: integer)
	Customers(cid: integer, name: string, budget: integer)

Shop.java

	A Java JDBCbased application run by customers, with name Shop.java.
	The application must have a commandline interface menu that allows the
	user to select one option as described below. Once that menu function 
	is completed, the program must return results if applicable and then 
	return to the main menu. For each menu option, you are allowed (and 
	even recommended, if needed) to have multiple steps (or “screens”) to 
	complete the tasks. You will use the DBS3 Oracle instance as DBMS.
